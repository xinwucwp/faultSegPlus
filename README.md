# FaultSeg3D plus: A comprehensive study on evaluating and improving CNN-based seismic fault segmentation


**Here we provide both Tensorflow and Pytorch versions of FaultSegPlus (improved from [faultSeg](https://github.com/xinwucwp/faultSeg) by Wu et al. (2019)) for 3D fault segmentation**

## Getting Started with Example Model for fault prediction

If you would just like to try out a pretrained example model, then you can download the [pretrained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MjcWmRG6uIZoH4E1_bfa9gXvABwp83kN/view?usp=drive_link) and use the 'apply.py' script to run a demo.


### Dataset

**To train our CNN network, we automatically created 400 pairs of synthetic seismic and corresponding fault volumes, which were shown to be more realistic and diverse than the [200 pairs](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1I-kBAfc_ag68xQsYgAHbqWYdddk4XHHd) published by Wu et al. (2019).** 

**The training and validation datasets will be uploaded soon**

### Training

Run train.py to start training a new faultSeg model by using the 400 synthetic datasets
